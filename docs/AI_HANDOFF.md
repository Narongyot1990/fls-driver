# AI Handoff Notes

This file is optimized for the next AI or engineer who needs to make changes quickly without re-learning the repo.

## Start Here

Open these files first:

1. `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
2. `docs/CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `src/services/leave.domain.ts`
4. `src/services/auth.domain.ts`
5. `src/middleware.ts`

## Current Source Of Truth For Leave Logic

- list/review/cancel/create logic: `src/services/leave.domain.ts`
- list endpoints: `src/app/api/leave/route.ts`
- review/cancel endpoint: `src/app/api/leave/[id]/route.ts`
- leader approval UI: `src/app/leader/approve/page.tsx`
- calendar UI: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- date-span helpers: `src/lib/leave-calendar.ts`
- shared leave/session types: `src/lib/app-types.ts`

## Recent Important Changes

### 1. Leader branch scope no longer trusts JWT branch blindly

Leader leave visibility now resolves branch from the database in `leave.domain.ts`.

Why:

- leader records can be updated while old JWTs still exist
- relying only on token branch caused empty approval lists

### 2. Leave request `userId` was normalized

Historical leave data previously mixed `string` and `ObjectId`.

Current safety measures:

- service queries still normalize mixed `$in` filters
- migration script exists in `scripts/migrate-leave-userids.mjs`

Before changing leave schema assumptions again:

1. run `npm run audit:leave-userids`
2. inspect results
3. migrate only if needed

### 3. Dashboard calendar now uses date keys

The dashboard previously relied on inline `Date` comparisons. It now uses `src/lib/leave-calendar.ts`.

Rule:

- do not reintroduce direct `Date` comparisons for day-span rendering unless timezone behavior is explicitly tested

## Current Data Model Reality

- `users` is the main personnel collection
- `leaders` still exists as a compatibility path for password login
- `admin_root` is still a special-case identity

This means a bug can be:

- a data problem
- a query scope problem
- a stale session payload problem

Always check all three before assuming only frontend or only database.

## Current High-Leverage Files By Task

### If leave approval is broken

- `src/services/leave.domain.ts`
- `src/app/leader/approve/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/approve/page.tsx`
- `src/lib/pusher.ts`

### If the dashboard calendar is wrong

- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `src/lib/leave-calendar.ts`
- `src/lib/thai-holidays.ts`

### If admin branch filtering is wrong

- `src/hooks/useAdminBranchScope.ts`
- `src/app/admin/*`
- `src/services/branches.domain.ts`

### If login/session flow is wrong

- `src/services/auth.domain.ts`
- `src/lib/jwt-auth.ts`
- `src/lib/api-auth.ts`
- `src/middleware.ts`

## Suggested Refactor Targets Later

These are not blockers, but they are good cleanup candidates:

- centralize repeated `/api/auth/me` page bootstrapping into a reusable hook
- reduce duplicated local interfaces in history and management pages
- replace `src/middleware.ts` with `proxy` when the team is ready for Next 16 cleanup
- keep migrating shared UI response types into `src/lib/app-types.ts`

## Verification Checklist Before Push

For leave/auth/dashboard changes:

1. `npm run build`
2. `npm run test`
3. `npm run audit:leave-userids`

For DB-sensitive leave changes:

1. confirm `LeaveRequest.userId` shape
2. confirm branch-scoped counts in MongoDB
3. confirm leader session branch in `/api/auth/me`

## Do Not Assume

- do not assume `leaders` collection is unused
- do not assume JWT branch is current
- do not assume calendar bugs are backend bugs
- do not assume leave visibility issues mean data is missing

Inspect the query, session, and stored document shape together.
